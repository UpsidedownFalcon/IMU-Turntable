# ASsembly Guide 

To have a functioning High-Tech Fidget Spinner, there are three high-level steps: 
1) Mechanical assembly 
2) Electronic assembly 
3) Flashing firmware 

Completing these three steps may take anywhere between **2 - 4+ hours**. Before starting, please make sure you have all of the materials from [```/build/BoM.md```](/build/BoM.md) and the appropriate tools. 

Let's begin! 

## Mechanical assembly 

The mechanical assembly is split into the following assemblies: 
- Z-frame subassembly 
- Y-frame subassembly 
- X-frame subassembly 

### Z-frame subassembly 
1) Assemble the 4 base pieces together like a jigsaw puzzle! 


2) Attach the Nema 17 42-60 to the Base Stepper Bracket 


3) Attach the E38S6G5-600B-G24 rotary encoder to the Base Rotary Encoder Bracket 


4) Mount the Base Stepper Bracket and Base Rotary Encoder Bracket to the base 


5) Attach the 4 Base Posts to the corners of the base 


6) SEcure the turntable bearing on top of the Base Posts 


7) Fix a shaft coupler to the shaft of the Nema 17 42-60 stepper motor. Fix a GT20 pulley around the shaft of t he E38S6G5-600B-G24 rotary encoder. Loop a 135mm GT20 timing belt around the pulley 


### Y-frame subassembly 
1) Slot the Y Bracket 1 and Y Bracket 2 into the Z Plate 


2) Add M5 screws and secure Y Bracket 1 and Y Bracket 2 with washers and nuts. Add M5 screws in the centre and around the edges of the Z Plate to fix it to the Z-frame subassembly 


3) Secure a GT20 timing pulley to the middle M5 screw of the Z Plate 


4) Mount the Y-frame subassembly on top of the Z-frame subassembly and fix using M5 nuts. 


### X-frame subassembly 
1) Screw the IMU Carriage_Top and IMU Carriage_Bottom together, with the semi-circles on them forming a complete hole. Run M5 screws with toothed washers through the holes 


2) Attach the IMU_Carriage to the X Bracket via the bearing inserts, while including the X Bobbin. Run M5 screws with toothed washers through the centre holes of the X Bracket 


3) Mount the Nema 17 42-23 and E38S6G5-600B-G24 rotary encoder respectively to the X Bracket and M5 screws of the IMU Carriage via the shaft couplings 


4) Attach the X Bracket to the Y-frame subassembly via the bearing inserts, while including the Y Bobbin 


5) Mount the Nema 17 42-38 and E38S6G5-600B-G24 rotary encoder to their respective Y Brackets
