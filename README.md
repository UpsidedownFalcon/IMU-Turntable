# High-Tech Fidget Spinner: 3-Axis IMU Turntable 

Welcome! This is an open-source project for the construction of a 3-DoF IMU turntable, named to be a "High-Tech Fidget Spinner". It is a low-cost alternative to commercial solutions which can cost in the 5 to 6-figure USD range, to be used for the validation and characterisation of IMU sensors.
